A Bifurcation Diagram Tool based on Niche PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) 
===========================================================================

I live in Mexico and need a job (I am interested in "remote" or "work-from-home" jobs).

This is a "simple" project I've been developing for a year and a half now (approximately).
Now I would like to use this a sample of what I can do (with help from the Scala community).

This project isn't finished (yet). But you can try the tests with:
> sbt test

You can read about this project in my thesis (it is thesis.pdf, a work that still has to
be reviewed).

This is my first serious software project and I started almost from zero, because I learned
to program by myself (mostly reading books, from Internet and asking on mailing lists and 
at IRC channels). *Before* starting this project:
+ I had limited Java experience (I've learned as much as I been able by reading from:
  + "Fundamentos de Programación. Aprendizaje activo basado en casos" from Villalobos/Casallas.
	+ "Estructuras de Datos con Java. Diseño de estructuras y algoritmos", from Lewis/Chase.
	+ "Core Java, Vol. 1: Fundamentals", from Cay Horstmann (8th. edition)
  My Java programming was almost "imperative"/"procedural" in style, doing some Computer Vision
	programming as I received classes from Dr. Félix Calderón at the UMSNH.
+ I tried to learn as much as I could from C++. Again, all by myself, just reading and trying to
  code some algorithms.
+ By the same token, I started learning Linux (I tried Ubuntu and then Arch Linux) because of
  curiosity. After some time, I could afford an iMac (my parents helped me with some money).
+ Python was the next programming language that draw my attention. I tried LaTeX and I love it.

In a few words: I love to learn and I don't have problems learning by myself. This way,
studying all by myself, I presented an exam for a Master in Science Program at the Universidad
Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo (Computer Science). As to day, I've been the only person
that has been accepted by examination (not with the usual way of a previous course). I consider
this a personal success because I am an Electronics Engineer, but I was able to learn some
programming by myself (numerical stuff has been my interest up to this day).

I was told to program in Java, but I started learning Scala, and, as stubborn as I am, decided
to keep going with this interesting language. This project is the result:
+ I tried to read as much as I could from "Programming in Scala" (2nd Ed.) from Martin Odersky.
+ Then I heard about functional programming and Scalaz. I started trying and asking. This project
  uses some scalaz: Validation, Lenses, and the Reader Monad somewhere (among other goodies).
+ I heard about a wizard called Miles Sabin and his Shapeless project. This project uses HLists,
  HMaps, polymorphic functions.
+ I was told to test my code. Then I tried ScalaTest and liked it. This project tests some numerics,
  and some GUI code using Fest-Swing.
+ The project requires Parsing a System of Differential Equations. I am using Combinator Parsers from
  Scala. This was hard for me.
+ My advisor works with Artificial Intelligence, so I had to use some computational algorithms in my
  thesis. I am using CIlib implementations for Niche PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization with Niches).

Now I am interested in Functional Programming and would love to gain proficiency in Haskell (but
I like Scala too). I heard about Idris and dependent type programming and I feel thrilled.

I am 30. Married. I've got one two-year-old son. I am confident I'll be graduating soon (a month).
But I want to take care of my parents, and my wife wants to stay close from her family. So I am
open to possibilities. I know very little about Web programming (I bought the Play for Scala book)
and started reading... I like Math. A lot. I don't fear learning abstract stuff. I am not a genius,
just a hard working guy that likes to read and study.

(As a side note, I have not been able to buy myself a pair of shoes for a while --although I've
spent some of my money buying electronic books--. Studying has been
a real sacrifice for me. The scholarship I received was not enough for my family and I had to get
some money from teaching ... with a tiny salary. Here in Mexico, you can have a hard time finding a
good employment...)
