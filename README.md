A Bifurcation Diagram Tool based on Niche PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) 
===========================================================================

I live in Mexico and need a job (I am interested in "remote" or "work-from-home" jobs).

This is a project (my first serious project) I've been developing for a year and a half now
(approximately).
Now I would like to use this a sample of what I can do (with help from the Scala community).

This project isn't finished (yet). But you can try the tests with:
> sbt test

You can read about this project in my thesis (it is thesis.pdf, a work that still has to
be reviewed).

*This is my first serious software project* and I started almost from zero, because I learned
to program by myself (mostly reading books, from Internet and asking on mailing lists and 
at IRC channels). 

If by any chance you know about "remote jobs" where I could be help (I can learn fast), email me at:
